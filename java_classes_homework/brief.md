# Java Classes Homework

Create your own class with an internal collection of a different class. It should have methods for `count`, `add`, `isFull` etc. Remember to write tests for your classes!

## Some examples:
* A `Bus` class with an array, `passengers` of `Person`s.
* A `Classroom` class with an array, `students` of `Person`s.
* A `Library` class with an array, `stock`, of `Book`s.

## Extensions:
Add a third class which interacts with the other two. E.g. you could add a `BusStop` with a method that takes a `Bus` and moves `Person`s from the `BusStop` to the `Bus`.
